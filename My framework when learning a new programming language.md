### Unit Testing in a Nutshell

- Unit testing involves feeding various inputs (test cases) to a function.- The outputs generated by the function are compared to expected outputs.
- If the outputs match, the function is considered to be working correctly.

### Solving the Last Word Length Problem

#### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing words and spaces, return the length of the last word in `s`.

#### JavaScript Solution

```javascript
// Function to find the length of the last word in a string
function findLastWordLength(s) {
  // Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from the string
  s = s.trim();
  
  // Split the string into an array of words based on whitespace
  let words = s.split(" ");
  
  // Get the last word from the array of words
  let lastWord = words[words.length - 1];
  
  // Return the length of the last word
  return lastWord.length;
}

// Example usage
const inputString = "Hello World";
const result = findLastWordLength(inputString);
console.log(`Length of the last word: ${result}`);
```

#### Explanation```

#### Explanation

- We start by trimming any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string (`s`) using `s.trim()`.
- We then split the string into an array of words (`words`) using the `split(" ")` method, where " " is the separator (whitespace).
- We access the last word from the `words` array using `words[words.length - 1]`.
- Finally, we return the length of the last word using `lastWord.length`.**How to Extract the Last Word from a String in JavaScript**

**Core Concept:**

To extract the last word from a string, we need to split the string into an array of words, then access the last element of the array.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

**Step 1: Split the String into an Array**

There are multiple ways to split a string into an array, including:

```javascript
// Using the split() method
const str = "hello world, my name is Girat";
const words = str.split(" ");

// Using the String.prototype.match() method
const words = str.match(/\S+/g);
```const words = str.match(/\S+/g);
```

**Step 2: Access the Last Element of the Array**

Once the string is split into an array, we can access the last element using the array's `length` property and zero-based indexing:

```javascript
const lastWord = words[words.length - 1];
```

**Example:**

```javascript
// Let's extract the last word from the string "hello world, my name is Girat"
const str = "hello world, my name is Girat";
const words = str.split(" ");
const lastWord = words[words.length - 1];
console.log(lastWord); // Output: Girat
```**Understand String Splitting in JavaScript**

**Introduction:**
- String splitting is a technique to divide a string into multiple substrings based on a specified delimiter.
- In JavaScript, the `split()` method is commonly used for splitting strings.

**Syntax:**
```
const splitArray = string.split(delimiter);
```

**Parameters:**
- `string`: The string to be split.```

**Parameters:**
- `string`: The string to be split.
- `delimiter`: The character or string used to separate the substrings. If omitted, whitespace characters (e.g., space, tab) are used as the default delimiter.

**Output:**
The `split()` method returns an array of substrings, separated by the specified delimiter.

**Example:**
```
const myString = "Hello, world!";
const splitString = myString.split(" ");

console.log(splitString); // Output: ["Hello,", "world!"]
```

**Log Debugging in JavaScript:**
- Log debugging involves printing variables to the console to help identify and resolve errors.
- To log variables in JavaScript, use the `console.log()` method.

**Syntax:**
```
console.log(variable_name);
```

**Parameter:**
- `variable_name`: The name of the variable to be logged.

**Example:**
```
console.log(splitString);
```## Understanding Test Cases

### What are Test Cases?```## Understanding Test Cases

### What are Test Cases?
Test cases are predefined inputs and expected outputs used to test the correctness and functionality of a function. They help ensure that the function behaves as intended for various inputs.

### Using Test Cases in Code Debugging
- Click on `Test Cases` to view pre-defined inputs for a function.
- Enter the desired input into the `Pass` field and click `Run` to execute the function with that input.
- Examine the `Standard Output` section to observe the output produced by the function.

### Sample Code Execution with Test Cases
Consider the code sample below:

```
def my_function(s):
    print(s)
    r = [1, 2, 3]
    print(r)
```

- Input: "hello world"
- Expected Output:
    - `hello world` (printed by `print(s)`)
    - `[1, 2, 3]` (printed by `print(r)`)

### Interpreting Test Case Results
- In the sample execution, the standard output matches the expected output, indicating that the function is behaving correctly for the input "hello world".- If the standard output differs from the expected output for any test case, it suggests that the function may contain errors that need to be investigated and fixed.## Understanding the Last Element of an Array

### Identifying the Last Index

In many programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed. This means that the index of the first element is 0, and the index of the last element is equal to the length of the array minus 1. For example, in the following array:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The last element is 5, and its index is 4.

### Accessing the Last Element

To access the last element of an array, we can use the following syntax:

```
array[array.length - 1]
```

For example, in the above array, we can access the last element as follows:

```
array[array.length - 1] // 5
```

### Example

Consider the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const lastElement = array[array.length - 1];

console.log(lastElement); // 5
```console.log(lastElement); // 5
```

In this example, we create an array called `array` and assign it the values 1 to 5. We then access the last element of the array using the `array.length - 1` index and store it in the variable `lastElement`. Finally, we log the value of `lastElement` to the console.**Markdown Notes on Hit and Trial Learning in JavaScript**

> Given a string, find the length of the last word in the string.

**Hit and Trial Approach:**

**Solution 1:**
```js
const lastElementLength = str.length;
```

**Result:** Fails for strings with trailing spaces or multiple spaces within the last word.

**Solution 2:**
```js
const lastWord = str.split(' ').pop();
const lastWordLength = lastWord.length;
```const lastWordLength = lastWord.length;
```

**Result:** Works for most cases, but may fail for edge cases like empty strings or strings with only spaces.

**Solution 3:**
```js
const trimmedString = str.trim();
const lastWord = trimmedString.split(' ').pop();
const lastWordLength = lastWord.length;
```

**Result:** Handles trailing and multiple spaces, making it a more robust solution.

**Learning Outcomes:**

Through this hit and trial process, you would have learned:

- `str.split(' ')` splits the string into an array of words.
- `Array.prototype.pop()` removes the last element from an array.
- The importance of handling edge cases when working with strings.**Mastering Array Filtering in JavaScript**

**Introduction**

Arrays in JavaScript can sometimes contain empty or unnecessary elements. Filtering is a powerful technique that allows us to remove those unwanted elements and obtain a cleaner, refined array.

**Step-by-Step Filtering****Step-by-Step Filtering**

1. **Understanding Filtering:** Filtering involves applying a logical test to each element in an array. If an element passes the test, it's included in the new array; otherwise, it's excluded.

2. **Syntax of Array.filter():**
   ```typescript
   array.filter((element) => {
       // Test whether to include element
   })
   ```

3. **Implementing Filtering:**
   - **Anonymous Function:** Create an anonymous function that defines the filtering logic.
   - **Arrow Function (ES6):** Use an arrow function for a concise syntax: `element => {}`.

4. **Example Code:**
   ```javascript
   const myArray = ['a', '', 'b', 'c', '', 'd'];

   const filteredArray = myArray.filter((element) => {
       return element !== '';
   });
   ```
   **Output:** `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`

**Benefits of Filtering**

- **Clean Data:** Removes unwanted elements, resulting in a refined array.
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces array size, leading to faster operations.- **Increased Clarity:** Makes code more readable and understandable.

**Additional Tips**

- Use the `Array.prototype.filter()` method, which is available to all arrays.
- Pay attention to the filtering logic to ensure correct results.
- Consider using `Array.prototype.includes()` for simple equality checks within the filtering function.
- Practice filtering on different arrays to solidify your understanding.**Introduction to Filtering Arrays in JavaScript**

**Understanding the Problem**

JavaScript arrays can sometimes contain unwanted elements. We may want to remove or "filter out" those elements to obtain a clean and specific subset of the original array.

**Approach: Filtering Using `Array.filter()`**

JavaScript provides the `Array.filter()` method, which allows us to filter an array based on a given condition. It takes a function as an argument that checks each element in the array and returns either `true` or `false`.

**Implementation**

```javascript**Implementation**

```javascript
const newArray = originalArray.filter((element) => {
  // Your condition to check the element
});
```

**Syntax Explanation**

- `originalArray`: The original array from which we want to filter elements.
- `newArray`: The new array that will contain the filtered elements.
- `filter((element))`: A function that takes each element in the original array as input and returns `true` if the condition is met and `false` otherwise.

**Example**

Suppose we have an array `R` and we want to remove all elements with a length of 0. We can use `Array.filter()` as follows:

```javascript
const R2 = R.filter((element) => {
  return element.length !== 0;
});
```

**Output**

`R2` will contain a new array with all the elements from `R` that have a length greater than 0.## Filtering Arrays in JavaScript

**Introduction****Introduction**

Arrays are essential data structures in JavaScript used to store sequences of elements. Filtering an array involves selecting a subset of elements that meet specific criteria. JavaScript offers a built-in function called `filter()` for efficient array filtering.

**Using the `filter()` Function**

The `filter()` function takes an array as input and returns a new array containing the elements that satisfy a given condition. The condition is specified using a callback function.

**Syntax:**

```
const filteredArray = originalArray.filter(callbackFunction);
```

**Callback Function:**

The callback function is invoked for each element in the original array. It takes two parameters:

* `element`: The current element being processed.
* `index`: The index of the current element.

The callback function should return `true` to include the element in the filtered array and `false` to exclude it.

**Example:**

To remove empty strings from an array, you can use the `filter()` function as follows:```
const originalArray = ["a", "", "b", "c", ""];
const filteredArray = originalArray.filter(element => element !== "");

console.log(filteredArray); // Output: ["a", "b", "c"]
```

**Advantages of Using the `filter()` Function**

* **Conciseness:** It provides a concise and readable way to filter arrays.
* **Immutability:** The original array remains unchanged, and the filtered array is a new object.
* **Chaining:** The `filter()` function can be chained with other array methods (e.g., `map()`, `reduce()`) to perform complex data transformations.## Understanding JavaScript's Filter Function

### Introduction
The `filter()` function is a powerful tool in JavaScript that allows you to create a new array containing only those elements that meet a specified condition.

### Using Filter with a Callback Function
- **Callback Function:** A function passed as an argument to another function.- In `filter()`, the callback function takes each element as an argument and returns `true` if it should be included in the new array or `false` if it should be excluded.

### Code Syntax
```javascript
const newArray = array.filter(callbackFunction);
```

### Step by Step Explanation
1. **Element Parameter:** The callback function receives each element of the original array as its first parameter.
2. **Returning Boolean:** The callback function should return `true` for elements to be included and `false` for elements to be excluded.
3. **Modified Array:** The `filter()` function creates a new array containing only the elements for which the callback function returned `true`.

### Example
```javascript
// Filter an array of strings to create an array of strings with length greater than 0
const originalArray = ['a', 'aa', 'aaa', '', 'aaaa', 'aaaaa'];
const filteredArray = originalArray.filter(element => element.length > 0);
console.log(filteredArray); // Output: ['aa', 'aaa', 'aaaa', 'aaaaa']
``````

### Key Insights
- `filter()` is a non-mutating function, meaning it doesn't modify the original array.
- The callback function can be any valid JavaScript function that returns `true` or `false`.
- `filter()` can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:
  - Removing elements from an array
  - Selecting elements that meet specific criteria
  - Transforming elements based on a condition## Understanding the Array Filter Method

### Introduction

The `filter()` method in programming allows you to transform an array into a new array by filtering out unwanted elements based on a given condition.

### Syntax

```
filteredArray = originalArray.filter(conditionFunction)
```

### Parameters

- `originalArray`: The array to be filtered.
- `conditionFunction`: A function that takes an element from the array as input and returns a `true` or `false` value.

### Working Principle### Working Principle

The `filter()` method iterates through each element in the original array and passes it to the `conditionFunction`. Based on the result of the function, it does the following:

- If `conditionFunction` returns `true`, the element is included in the new array.
- If `conditionFunction` returns `false`, the element is excluded from the new array.

### Example

Consider the following code:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, we use the `filter()` method to create a new array (`evenNumbers`) containing only even numbers from the original array (`numbers`). The `conditionFunction` checks if each element is divisible by 2 without a remainder (i.e., `num % 2 === 0`) and returns `true` if the condition is met, or `false` otherwise.

### Implementation### Implementation

The following is a simplified implementation of the `filter()` method in JavaScript:

```javascript
Array.prototype.myFilter = function (conditionFunction) {
  const filteredArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    if (conditionFunction(this[i])) {
      filteredArray.push(this[i]);
    }
  }
  return filteredArray;
};
```

This implementation iterates through the array, calls the `conditionFunction` for each element, and adds the element to the `filteredArray` if the condition is met.**Mastering Clean Coding Practices**

Instead of implementing a handwritten sorting algorithm, you can use the built-in `Array.sort()` method in JavaScript. This simplifies the code, ensures consistency, and leverages the optimized sorting algorithm provided by the JavaScript runtime.

```javascript
// Sorting an array of numbers in JavaScript

// Native sorting method (clean code)
const sortedNumbers = numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

// Handwritten sorting algorithm (ugly code)
const uglySortedNumbers = [];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
    if (numbers[i] > numbers[j]) {
      const temp = numbers[i];
      numbers[i] = numbers[j];
      numbers[j] = temp;
    }
  }
  uglySortedNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
}
```

**Conclusion**uglySortedNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
}
```

**Conclusion**

Writing clean code is essential for effective collaboration, maintainability, and scalability. By understanding the principles of clean coding and leveraging language-specific features, you can create code that is readable, maintainable, and extensible. Remember, the goal is not merely to solve problems but to produce code that is a valuable asset to your team and organization.## Understanding the Filter Function

use yew::prelude::*;

struct Model {
    count: i32,
}

enum Msg {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}

impl Component for Model {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self { count: 0 }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Increment => { self.count += 1; false }
            Msg::Decrement => { self.count -= 1; false }
        }
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            <div>
                <button onclick=|_| Msg::Increment>{ "+1" }</button>
                <span>{ self.count }</span>
                <button onclick=|_| Msg::Decrement>{ "-1" }</button>
            </div>
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::Renderer::<Model>::new().render();
}
```
- This code demonstrates the core concepts of Rust-based front-end development using the Yew framework.
