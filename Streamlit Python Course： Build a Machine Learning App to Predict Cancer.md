## Introduction to Software Development and Artificial Intelligence with Python

### Overview
- Python is a versatile programming language used in both software development and artificial intelligence (AI).
- In this tutorial, we'll build a complete Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that incorporates:
 - Data processing
 - Machine learning (ML) training
 - Prediction visualization
- By the end, you'll have a project to showcase your skills.

### Foundation Concepts
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user-friendly interface for interacting with a computer program through visual elements like buttons, menus, and graphics.
- **Data Processing:** Manipulating and analyzing data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Algorithms that allow computers to learn from data without explicit programming.

### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **GUI Creation:**
 - Use a library like Tkinter or PyQt5 to create a user-friendly interface with inputs, buttons, and a chart.2. **Data Processing:**
 - Import and format the data you want to analyze.
 - Visualize the data using the GUI chart.

3. **ML Training:**
 - Use the scikit-learn library to train an ML model (e.g., logistic regression) based on the input data.
 - Update the model parameters as the user changes inputs on the GUI.

4. **Prediction and Visualization:**
 - Make predictions using the trained ML model.
 - Display the predictions and updated charts in the GUI, allowing users to see the impact of their inputs.

### Syntax and Example
```python
# Import GUI library
import tkinter as tk

# Create a GUI window
window = tk.Tk()

# Add a label
label = tk.Label(window, text="Enter Input: ")
label.pack()

# Add an input field
input_field = tk.Entry(window)
input_field.pack()

# Create a button
button = tk.Button(window, text="Submit")
button.pack()

# Define the function to handle button click
def submit_input():
    # Get input from the input field
    input_value = input_field.get()input_value = input_field.get()
    
    # Process the input value and make a prediction
    prediction = make_prediction(input_value)
    
    # Display the prediction in the GUI
    prediction_label = tk.Label(window, text=f"Prediction: {prediction}")
    prediction_label.pack()

# Start the GUI event loop
window.mainloop()
```
In this example, the user enters an input value in the GUI, which is then processed and used to make a prediction. The prediction is displayed in a new label in the GUI, allowing the user to see the result of their input.**Markdown Notes on Cancer Cell Classification using Machine Learning**

```## Introduction to Cancer Cell Classification Using Machine Learning

**Goal:** Predict whether a cell cluster is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on various measurements.

### Data Set

* **Source:** University of Wisconsin
* **Variables:** Measurements of cell clusters (e.g., radius mean, texture mean, perimeter mean)
* **Target Variable:** Diagnosis (M for malignant, B for benign)### Machine Learning Model

We will train a machine learning model to:

* **Predictors:** The measurements of the cell clusters
* **Target:** The diagnosis of the cell clusters

### Model Training

The model will learn to identify patterns in the measurements that distinguish benign from malignant cell clusters.

**1. Project Structure: A Quick Overview**

   - **Project Folder**: A dedicated directory for your project named `streamlit-app` (or similar).
   - **Model Folder**: Contains the model training scripts and data cleaning code.
   - **Data Folder**: Stores the dataset (CSV file in this case, imported from Kaggle).
   - **App Folder**: Future home to the Streamlit app.

**2. Data Cleaning Essentials**

   - Step 1: Check for `NaN` (missing) values.
   - Step 2: Examine data types and ensure they align with the model's requirements.
   - Step 3: Identify and address any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

**Syntax:**

```python
import pandas as pd**Syntax:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('data/cancer.csv')

# Check for missing values (NaNs)
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Examine data types
print(df.dtypes)
```## Notes on Setting Up a Streamlit Application

### Understanding the Structure

**main.py**:
- Entry point for the Streamlit application.
- Contains code for user interface, data handling, and model deployment.

### Code Customization

**if __name__ == '__main__'**:
- Python construct to check if the file is being directly executed, not imported.
- Ensures that the main application code runs only when the file is executed directly.

### Step-by-Step Data Processing

1. Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
2. Load the data.
3. Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
4. Build the model using scikit-learn or other libraries.
5. Save the model for future use.

### Example

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')# Load data from CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean data
df['column'] = df['column'].fillna(0)

# Create a model using scikit-learn
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(df[['feature1', 'feature2']], df['target'])

# Save the model
import pickle
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
```## Getting Started with Pandas

### Introduction

Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

### Installation

To use Pandas, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Importing Pandas

After installation, you can import Pandas into your code:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

### Reading Data

To read data from a CSV file, use `pd.read_csv()`:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```

The above code will read the CSV file named "data.csv" and store the data in a Pandas DataFrame named `df`.### Creating a Function to Clean Data

You can create a function to clean and prepare your data:

```python
def get_clean_data(datafile):
    df = pd.read_csv(datafile)
    return df
```

This function takes a CSV filename as input and returns a cleaned Pandas DataFrame.## Data Cleaning in Data Analysis

### Overview

Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis that involves identifying and rectifying errors or inconsistencies in raw data to prepare it for analysis.

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Exploratory Analysis (For New Datasets)**

* Examine the data to identify potential issues and understand its structure and content.
* Look for missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

**2. Data Cleaning (For Known Datasets)**

* If you are familiar with the dataset, you can apply specific cleaning procedures based on your knowledge.
* This can include dropping irrelevant columns, imputing missing values, and standardizing data formats.

### Example: Dropping an Irrelevant Column in Python### Example: Dropping an Irrelevant Column in Python

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Drop the irrelevant column
df.drop('unnamed_32', axis=1, inplace=True)
```

### Benefits of Data Cleaning

* Improves data quality and accuracy
* Ensures consistency and reliability of analysis results
* Facilitates efficient data processing and analysis
* Helps identify potential biases or errors in the raw data
* Allows for accurate data visualization and modeling## Data Manipulation and Transformation

### Dropping Columns

- **Syntax**: `df.drop(columns, axis=0 or 1)`
- **Example**:
   ```python
   df.drop(columns=['unnamed_32', 'ID'], axis=1)  # Drop 'unnamed_32' and 'ID' columns
   ```

- **Explanation**:
   - `df.drop()` removes specified columns from the DataFrame.
   - `columns` is a list of column names to drop.
   - `axis=0` drops rows, while `axis=1` drops columns.

### Encoding Categorical Variables

- **Syntax**: `df['column'].map(dict)`- **Syntax**: `df['column'].map(dict)`
- **Example**:
   ```python
   df['diagnosis'] = df['diagnosis'].map({'Benign': 0, 'Malignant': 1})  # Encode 'Benign' as 0 and 'Malignant' as 1
   ```

- **Explanation**:
   - `df['column'].map()` applies a function to each element of a specified column.
   - In this case, the function is a mapping dictionary that converts 'Benign' to 0 and 'Malignant' to 1.**Clean Data for Model Training: Replace Values**

**Concept:**
To train a model effectively, it's essential to clean the data to ensure it's free from inconsistencies and errors. This involves replacing values with more appropriate representations for model training.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Target Value:** Determine the value that needs to be replaced with a more suitable counterpart.

2. **Define Replacement Value:** Specify the value that will replace the existing value. Ensure it aligns with the model's requirements.3. **Perform Replacement:** Use appropriate methods to replace the original values with the new values.

**Example:**

In the provided text, a DataFrame is being transformed to prepare it for model training. The goal is to replace values in the 'diagnosis' column with ones and zeros.

**Code Snippet:**

```
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with 'diagnosis' column
data = pd.DataFrame({'diagnosis': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]})

# Replace 'malicious' (1) with 'benign' (0)
data['diagnosis'].replace({1: 0, 0: 1}, inplace=True)
```

**Explanation:**

* The `replace()` method is used to replace values in the 'diagnosis' column.
* The dictionary argument `{1: 0, 0: 1}` specifies that values equal to 1 will be replaced with 0, and values equal to 0 will be replaced with 1.
* The `inplace=True` parameter modifies the DataFrame directly, replacing the original values with the new values.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use the `info()` method to inspect the DataFrame and ensure the desired columns and values are present.* Validate the cleaned data to verify that the replacement process was successful and the data is suitable for model training.**Markdown Notes on Data Preparation and Model Creation**

## Data Manipulation

**Step 1: Divide Data into Predictors and Target Variable**

- **Predictors (X)**: Features used to predict the target variable.
- **Target Variable (y)**: The variable being predicted.

```python
# Divide data into predictors and target variable
X = data.drop("diagnosis", axis=1)  # Drop the target variable (diagnosis) to get predictors
y = data["diagnosis"]  # Target variable is the diagnosis column
```

## Data Scaling

**Step 2: Scale Data (Optional)**

- Scaling brings all variables to a similar range to improve model accuracy.
- Example: Some variables may be in thousands while others are in decimals. Scaling ensures they are treated equally by the model.

```python
# Scale the data using a scaling method of your choice, e.g., StandardScaler or MinMaxScalerfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```**Data Scaling with Standard Scalar**

**Objective:**

To ensure that data has a uniform scale, which is essential for machine learning models to perform effectively.

**Steps:**

1. **Import Standard Scalar:**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

2. **Create a Standard Scalar:**

```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
```

3. **Scale Training Predictors:**

```python
x = scaler.fit_transform(x)
```

**Explanation:**

**Data Scaling:**

Data scaling involves transforming data to have a consistent range, making it easier for machine learning models to learn patterns and make predictions.

**Standard Scalar:**

A standard scalar is a scaling method that transforms features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that all features have the same scale and influence the model equally.

**Scaling Only Predictors:****Scaling Only Predictors:**

Typically, only the predictors (independent variables) are scaled, while the target variable (dependent variable) remains unchanged. This is because the target variable often represents a different concept or measure than the predictors.

**Importance of Scaling:**

Scaling ensures that features with different units and magnitudes are treated equally by the model. Without scaling, features with larger magnitudes could dominate the model's predictions, potentially leading to biased results.**Data Preparation: Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets**

**Introduction:**
Before training a machine learning model, it's crucial to divide the available data into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance and avoid overfitting.

**Step 1: Import the Necessary Library**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

**Step 2: Split the Data**```

**Step 2: Split the Data**
To split the data, use the `train_test_split` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` library. This function takes three arguments:
1. `X`: The data features or predictors.
2. `y`: The target variable or labels.
3. `test_size`: The proportion of the data to be used for the testing set (e.g., 0.2 for 20%).

Example:
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

**Benefits of Data Splitting:**
* **Avoids Overfitting:** Training a model only on the entire dataset can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Splitting the data provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.
* **More Accurate Performance Evaluation:** The testing set provides a more realistic assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new data.* **Easier Hyperparameter Tuning:** Splitting the data allows for easier tuning of model hyperparameters, such as learning rate or regularization strength, using cross-validation techniques.## Training a Logistic Regression Model in Python

**Introduction**

Logistic regression is a statistical model used to predict the probability of an event occurring. It is commonly used in machine learning for tasks such as binary classification (e.g., predicting whether an email is spam or not).

**Step 1: Data Preparation**

Before training a logistic regression model, the data must be split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to develop the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

**Step 2: Importing Libraries**

Import the necessary libraries for training the model:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

**Step 3: Model Creation**

Create a logistic regression model:

```python
model = LogisticRegression()
```

**Step 4: Model Training**model = LogisticRegression()
```

**Step 4: Model Training**

Fit the model to the training data:

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Breakdown:**

* `X_train` is the matrix of training predictor variables.
* `y_train` is the vector of target variables (e.g., class labels).

**Step 5: Evaluation**

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the class labels for the test data:

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

**Breakdown:**

* `X_test` is the matrix of test predictor variables.
* `y_pred` is the vector of predicted class labels.

The accuracy of the model can then be evaluated by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels in the test set.**Markdown Notes on the Machine Learning Workflow**

**Introduction**

This workflow outlines the steps involved in creating, training, and testing a machine learning model.

**Step 1: Creating the Model****Step 1: Creating the Model**

- **Choosing the Model Type:** Select a model type (e.g., logistic regression) based on the problem being solved and the data available.

**Step 2: Training the Model**

- **Preparing the Data:** Clean and format the data, removing errors and outliers.
- **Splitting the Data:** Divide the data into two sets: training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
- **Training the Model:** Use the training data to fit the model parameters. This process involves algorithms that minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes.

**Step 3: Evaluating the Model**

- **Calculating Metrics:** Use the testing set to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics evaluate the model's performance in different aspects.- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** If the model's performance is not satisfactory, adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization) to optimize the model's performance.

**Step 4: Deploying the Model**

- **Exporting the Model:** Save the trained model to disk or a database for future use.
- **Returning Scalar:** Additionally, store any necessary preprocessing or scaling values (scalar) separately. This information is often used for making predictions later on.

**Step 5: Testing the Model**

- **Creating a Test Function:** Define a function to run the model on a new dataset (e.g., a real-world scenario).
- **Testing the Model:** Use the test function to test the model's performance on the new data. This step verifies the model's generalizability and accuracy in real-world conditions.

**Example Code**

```python
# Step 1: Creating the Model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Step 2: Training the Model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 3: Evaluating the Model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)

# Step 4: Deploying the Model
import pickle
pickle.dump(model, open('my_model.pkl', 'wb'))
pickle.dump(scaler, open('my_scalar.pkl', 'wb'))

# Step 5: Testing the Model
def test_model(X_new):
    predictions = model.predict(X_new)
    return predictions

   macro avg       0.99      0.99      0.99         4
weighted avg       0.99      0.97      0.97         4
```

**Interpretation:**

- The model has an accuracy of 97%.
- For benign (0) cell clusters, it has a precision of 100%, meaning it correctly identified all benign clusters.
- For malicious (1) cell clusters, it has a precision of 98% and a recall of 98%, indicating that it correctly identified 98% of malicious clusters and missed only 2%.## Notes: Model Evaluation and Export

### Model Evaluation

**F1 Score:**
- A weighted average of precision and recall.**F1 Score:**
- A weighted average of precision and recall.
- Important when the data is imbalanced (i.e., one class has significantly fewer samples than the others).

**Precision:**
- The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.
- Measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive samples.

**Recall:**
- The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
- Measures the model's ability to correctly identify all positive samples.

### Model Export

**Exporting the Model and Scaling:**
- Once the model is trained and evaluated, it needs to be exported for use in applications.
- Scaling, if performed during training, should also be exported to apply the same scaling to new data.

### Code Syntax

```python
# Export the trained model and scaling
model.save('model.pkl')  # save the model
scaler.save('scaler.pkl')  # save the scaling
```

### Example

```python
# Import the exported model and scaling
model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
scaler = pickle.load(open('scaler.pkl', 'rb'))

# Scale new data using the exported scaling
scaled_data = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Predict using the exported model
predictions = model.predict(scaled_data)
```## Expert Notes: Machine Learning Model Deployment

### Key Concepts

- **Training:** The process of building a model using historical data.
- **Deployment:** The process of deploying the trained model into an application for use.
- **Scalar:** A function that transforms data to a common scale.
- **Model Export:** The process of saving the trained model and scalar in a format that can be used by the application.

### Step-by-Step Deployment Process

1. **Train the Model:** Using historical data, train a machine learning model to make predictions.
2. **Transform Data:** Apply the scaling function (scalar) to the data to bring it into a consistent format.3. **Export Model and Scalar:** Save the trained model and scalar in a format compatible with the application.
4. **Integrate into Application:** Import the exported model and scalar into the application.

### Importance of Model Export

Deploying the model inside the application instead of training it on the fly has several advantages:

- **Performance Improvement:** Avoids training a new model every time the application opens, significantly reducing startup time and improving responsiveness.
- **Reduced Server Load:** Training models can be resource-intensive, so exporting them reduces server load.
- **Scalability:** Exported models can be easily deployed to multiple servers, ensuring scalability as user demand grows.

### Example Code (Python):

```python
# Import model and scalar
import model, scalar

# Load the exported model and scalar
model = load_model('my_model.h5')
scalar = load_scalar('my_scalar.pkl')

# Use the model for prediction
prediction = model.predict(scalar.transform(new_data))prediction = model.predict(scalar.transform(new_data))
```**Title: Saving and Loading Machine Learning Models with Python's pickle**

**Concept 1: Exporting a Model for Deployment**

- Deploying a machine learning model involves making it accessible to other applications or platforms.
- Serializing the model into a binary file allows for its easy transfer and use in different environments.

**Step 1: Installing the pickle Module**

- Run the command `pip install pickle` to install the package that enables binary file handling.

**Step 2: Importing the pickle Module**

- Import the pickle module using the following code:
```python
import pickle
```

**Concept 2: Saving a Model to a Binary File**

- The pickle module provides methods for saving objects to binary files.
- To export a model, open the file in write mode and use the `pickle.dump` function to serialize the model.

**Step 3: Opening the Destination File**

- Open a file with the extension `.pickle` to store the binary data.
```python```python
with open('model.pickle', 'wb') as file:
```

**Step 4: Serializing the Model**

- Serialize the model using the `pickle.dump` function and pass it the model object.
```python
pickle.dump(model, file)
```

**Concept 3: Loading a Model from a Binary File**

- To load a previously saved model, open the file in read mode and use the `pickle.load` function to deserialize the model.

**Step 5: Opening the Model File**

- Open the binary file that stores the model in read mode.
```python
with open('model.pickle', 'rb') as file:
```

**Step 6: Deserializing the Model**

- Deserialize the model using the `pickle.load` function and assign it to a variable.
```python
loaded_model = pickle.load(file)
```

**Concept 4: Using the Loaded Model**

- The loaded model can now be used for making predictions or other tasks it was trained for.

**Note:**

- The pickle module can be used to serialize and deserialize any Python object, not just machine learning models.- It's important to note that the pickle module is not secure and should not be used to serialize sensitive data.**Topic: Saving and Loading Binary Files Using `pickle` Module**

**Introduction****Introduction**

Pickle is a powerful Python module used to serialize and deserialize objects, including trained machine learning models and scalers. Serializing refers to converting an object to a byte stream for storage or transmission, while deserialization is the reverse process of recreating the object from the byte stream.

**Steps to Save Trained Models and Scalers using Pickle:**

1. **Import the pickle module:**
```python
import pickle
```

2. **Create a file-like object to hold the serialized data:**
```python
with open('model.pickle', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
```

3. **Dump the model into the file object using pickle.dump():**
```python
with open('scaler.pickle', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(scaler, f)
```

**Steps to Import Saved Models and Scalers using Pickle:**

1. **Import the pickle module:**
```python
import pickle
```

2. **Open the serialized files:**
```python
with open('model.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
```model = pickle.load(f)
```

3. **Load the model from the file object using pickle.load():**
```python
with open('scaler.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)
```

**Benefits of using Pickle:**

* **Cross-platform compatibility:** Pickle can serialize objects that can be deserialized on different platforms or systems.
* **Simplicity:** The pickle interface is straightforward and easy to use.
* **Flexibility:** Pickle can serialize a wide variety of objects, including custom classes and dictionaries.

**Additional Notes:**

* Pickling a model saves its trained weights and parameters, allowing it to be used for predictions.
* Scaling is often necessary before training a model to ensure all features are on the same scale.
* Saving both the trained model and the scaler allows for reusability and reproducibility of the machine learning pipeline.## Introduction to Streamlit Applications

### Understanding the Syntax

To run a Streamlit application from a Python script (`main.py`):

```python
streamlit run main.py
```

### Starting the Application

**Note:** Running `python main.py` will not execute the application.

1. Run the command: `streamlit run main.py`1. Run the command: `streamlit run main.py`
2. Select the target file (if there are multiple options).
3. The application will launch in your browser.

### Understanding the App Structure

Your application has a default structure:

- **Container:** A large area with a wide margin.
- **Layout:** The layout of the app, specified as `light` (default) or `dark`.
- **Sidebar:** An optional sidebar for adding additional content.

### Customizing the App Layout

To adjust the layout:

- Set the `layout` parameter to `wide` to create a wider layout.
- Set the `initial_sidebar_state` parameter to `collapsed` or `expanded` to control sidebar visibility.

### Example: Customizing the Layout

```python
streamlit run main.py --layout wide --initial_sidebar_state collapsed
```**Understanding Streamlit: A Guide to Creating Interactive Web Apps**

### Overview
- Divs are HTML elements used to group and structure content on web pages.
- They define a container for other HTML elements, allowing you to control their placement and appearance.

### Creating Divs
```html
<div>
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
``````html
<div>
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

### Adding Content to Divs
- To add text content, use the `innerText` property:
```html
<div id="container">
  <p>This is the content inside the div.</p>
</div>

<script>
  const container = document.getElementById("container");
  container.innerText = "Updated text content";
</script>
```

### Styling Divs
- Use CSS to control the appearance of divs, such as:
  - `background-color`: sets the background color
  - `width` and `height`: sets the dimensions
  - `margin` and `padding`: controls spacing

### Example
Consider the following HTML code:
```html
<div id="main-container">
  <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
  <p>This is the main content of my website.</p>
</div>
```

- The `<div>` with the `id="main-container"` defines the main container for the website's content.
- Inside it, an `<h1>` heading and a `<p>` paragraph are contained.- By using CSS, you can style the container to have a specific background color, width, and margins.**Markdown Notes on Building a Breast Cancer Diagnostic App**

**Introduction**

<div class="container">
  <div class="column1">
    <h1>Breast Cancer Diagnostic App</h1>
    <p>Connect this app to the cytology lab to help diagnose breast cancer from your tissue sample.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
    <form>
      <label for="mass-size">Mass Size:</label>
      <input type="range" id="mass-size" min="0" max="10">
      <label for="cell-shape">Cell Shape:</label>
      <input type="range" id="cell-shape" min="0" max="10">
      <input type="submit" value="Predict">
    </form>
    <p id="prediction"><b>Prediction:</b> Benign</p>
  </div>
</div>
```## Creating Columns in Streamlit
In Streamlit, columns are used to manage the page's layout and organize various elements horizontally.

### Syntax:
```
st.columns(column_list)
```### Syntax:
```
st.columns(column_list)
```
* **column_list**: A list that specifies the number of columns and their width ratios.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
**1. Create the Column List:**
```
column_list = [width1, width2, ..., widthN]
```
* Each element in the list represents the width ratio of a particular column.

**2. Call the st.columns Function:**
```
col1, col2, ..., colN = st.columns(column_list)
```
* This returns a list of column objects that you can use to add content to each column.

**3. Add Content to Columns:**
```
with col1:
    st.write("Content for Column 1")
with col2:
    st.write("Content for Column 2")
```
* Use the `with` statement to access each column object and add content using any Streamlit functions.

### Example:
```
import streamlit as st

# Create 2 columns with a 4:1 width ratio
col1, col2 = st.columns([4, 1])

# Add text to Column 1
with col1:
    st.write("This is a wider column.")

# Add a chart to Column 2
with col2:
    st.line_chart([1, 2, 3, 4])
```with col2:
    st.line_chart([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

This code creates two columns on the page. The first column is 4 times wider than the second column. The first column contains text, while the second column contains a line chart.**Markdown Notes: Creating a Sidebar with Streamlit**

**Introduction:**
Streamlit is a Python library that simplifies the development of interactive web applications. One key component of Streamlit applications is the sidebar, which allows users to easily interact with the app.

**Creating a Sidebar:**

# Add a slider to the sidebar```python
# Add a slider to the sidebar
slider_value = sidebar.slider('Slider', min_value=0.0, max_value=10.0, value=5.0)
```

4. Use the widget values to generate charts, predictions, or other desired output.
```python
# Generate a chart based on the slider value
chart_data = generate_data(slider_value)
st.line_chart(chart_data)
```

**Example:**

```python
import streamlit as st

# Create a sidebar
sidebar = st.sidebar

# Add a slider to the sidebar
slider_value = sidebar.slider('Slider', min_value=0.0, max_value=10.0, value=5.0)

# Generate a chart based on the slider value
chart_data = generate_data(slider_value)
st.line_chart(chart_data)
```

**Conclusion:**
Using Streamlit's sidebar, you can easily add user input options and control the functionality of your web application. By following these steps, you can create dynamic and interactive apps that respond to user input in real-time.**Creating a Customizable Data Slider**

**1. Introduction****1. Introduction**

To visualize and explore data effectively, dynamic sliders can be created for individual variables.

**2. Setting Up the Sliders**

* Ensure you have the data with all necessary predictors.
* Create a function to generate the sliders:
```
function createSidebar() {
  // Logic for creating sliders
}
```

**3. Generating the Sliders**

* Iterate through the predictors in the data.
* For each predictor, create a slider with:
  * A unique identifier tied to the predictor.
  * A current value representing the predictor value.
  * A range that allows for adjusting the value.

**4. Updating the Data**

* When a slider value changes, update the corresponding predictor value in the data.

**5. Visualizing the Changes**

* Connect the sliders to a visualization, such as a chart or graph.
* As the sliders are adjusted, the visualization will update dynamically, reflecting the changes in the data.

**Example:**

```
// Create slider for predictor "age"
const ageSlider = createSlider({
  id: "age",const ageSlider = createSlider({
  id: "age",
  value: 20,
  min: 18,
  max: 100
});

// Update data when slider value changes
ageSlider.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
  data["age"] = e.target.value;
  updateChart(data);
});
```

**Benefits of Data Sliders:**

* Allow for interactive exploration of data.
* Provide a visual understanding of how individual variables affect outcomes.
* Empower users to create custom visualizations based on their specific interests.**Markdown Notes: Adding a Sidebar to Your Notion App**

### Background### Background
In Streamlit, sliders are used to create interactive input controls that allow users to adjust numerical values within a specified range. To ensure optimal user experience, it is important to set appropriate maximum values for these sliders.

### Issue
The default maximum value for a slider in Streamlit is 100, which may not be suitable for all datasets. If the actual values in your dataset are significantly lower than 100, it can make it difficult for users to accurately select desired values.

### Solution
There are two approaches to address this issue:

#### 1. Custom Maximum Value Object

This method involves creating a custom Python object that contains the maximum values, column labels, and any other relevant information for the sliders. This object can then be exported from the module or script where the sliders are defined.

**Syntax:**

```
class SliderValues:
    def __init__(self, columns, max_values):
        self.columns = columns
        self.max_values = max_values
```self.max_values = max_values
```

**Example:**

```
from streamlit_slider_values import SliderValues

slider_values = SliderValues(
    columns=["Age", "Income"],
    max_values=[65, 100000]
)
```

#### 2. Streamlit App Callback

This method involves using a Streamlit callback to dynamically update the maximum value of the slider based on the actual data.

**Syntax:**

```
import streamlit as st

@st.cache
def get_max_value(column):
    # Fetch the maximum value for the specified column from the dataset
    max_value = ...
    return max_value

max_value = get_max_value(column_name)
st.slider(...)
```

**Example:**

```
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Age": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45],
    "Income": [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000, 90000]
})

@st.cache
def get_max_value(column):
    return df[column].max()

max_age = get_max_value("Age")
max_income = get_max_value("Income")

st.slider("Age", min_value=0, max_value=max_age)st.slider("Age", min_value=0, max_value=max_age)
st.slider("Income", min_value=0, max_value=max_income)
```

### Conclusion
By implementing either of these solutions, you can ensure that the maximum values for your sliders are tailored to the specific data in your dataset, providing a more user-friendly and accurate input experience for your Streamlit application.**Importing Data into a React App**

**Understanding Context:**

- Data is often managed as separate files or databases in real-world applications.
- For small datasets and rapid development, it can be convenient to import data directly within the application.

**Importing Data within the React App:**

**Step 1: Define a Data Loading Function**

- Create a function in a separate file or in the same component to fetch and clean the data.

```js
const getCleanData = () => {
  // Code to fetch and clean data
  return cleanedData;
};
```

**Step 2: Call the Loading Function in the SideBar Component****Step 2: Call the Loading Function in the SideBar Component**

- Import the data loading function in the `Sidebar` component.
- Call the function and assign the result to a variable.

```js
import { getCleanData } from "./dataLoader";

const Sidebar = () => {
  const data = getCleanData();
  // ...
};
```

**Step 3: Extract Column Names**

- To get the column names as a list, use the following code:

```js
const columnNames = Object.keys(data[0]);
```

**Caution:**

- Importing data directly within an app is not recommended in production applications.
- In a real-world scenario, data should be imported in a central script and then exported for use in various components.## Understanding the Code for Slider Label Customization

### Step 1: Creating a List of Labels and Column Names

- Start by creating a list that contains two columns:
    - **Label:** The label that will be displayed on the slider.
    - **Column Name:** The name of the column from which the maximum value for the slider will be derived.### Step 2: Using ChatGPT to Generate the List

- To save time, you can use ChatGPT to generate the list automatically.
- Simply provide ChatGPT with the dataset and request it to create a list with the desired columns.

### Sample Code:

```python
labels = ChatGPT.generate_slider_labels(dataset)
```

### Step 3: Looping Through the Labels

- Iterate through the generated list using a loop.

### Syntax:

```python
for label, column_name in labels:
    # Code to customize the slider using the label and column name
```

### Example:

```python
for label, column_name in labels:
    slider.label = label
    slider.maximum = dataset[column_name].max()
```**Creating Interactive Sliders for DataFrame Columns in Python**

**Objective:**
To create interactive sliders for each column in a DataFrame using Streamlit.

**Steps:**

1. **Import Libraries:**

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
```

2. **Create Sidebar Sliders:**

```python
# Create a list of column names to display as slider labels# Create a list of column names to display as slider labels
column_names = ['Column 1', 'Column 2', ...]

# Create a sidebar with the sliders using the `st.sidebar` function
sidebar = st.sidebar

# Iterate through the column names
for label, key in zip(column_names):
    # Create a slider with the specified label and key
    slider = sidebar.slider(
        label,
        min_value=min(df[key]),
        max_value=max(df[key]),
        value=min(df[key]),
        step=1
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* We create a list of column names to use as labels for the sliders.
* We create a sidebar using `st.sidebar` and iterate through the column names.
* For each column name, we create a slider using `st.slider()` and set the following attributes:
    * `label`: The label to display for the slider.
    * `min_value`: The minimum value of the slider.
    * `max_value`: The maximum value of the slider.
    * `value`: The initial value of the slider.
    * `step`: The step size for adjusting the slider value.* `step`: The step size for adjusting the slider value.

**Example:**

```python
# Create a DataFrame with some data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Column 1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Column 2': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
})

# Create the sliders
column_names = ['Column 1', 'Column 2']

for label, key in zip(column_names):
    slider = sidebar.slider(
        label,
        min_value=min(df[key]),
        max_value=max(df[key]),
        value=min(df[key]),
        step=1
    )
```

This code will create two sliders in the sidebar, one for 'Column 1' and one for 'Column 2'. The sliders will allow users to adjust the values and filter the DataFrame based on the selected ranges.**Understanding IPython Widgets**

**Introduction**

IPython Widgets are interactive, graphical elements that allow you to control and display data in a Jupyter Notebook or other IPython environments.

**Key Concepts**

* **Widgets:** Interactive elements that can be used to change input parameters or display data.* **Layout:** Containers that organize widgets into specific arrangements.
* **Interactions:** Events that trigger when users interact with widgets (e.g., clicking, dragging).
* **Observables:** Properties that can be monitored for changes, triggering callbacks when values change.

**Basic Widgets**

**Syntax:** `from ipywidgets import WidgetName` (e.g., `from ipywidgets import IntSlider`)

* **IntSlider:** Slider widget for adjusting integer values (e.g., `IntSlider(min=0, max=100)`)
* **FloatSlider:** Slider widget for adjusting floating-point values (e.g., `FloatSlider(min=0.0, max=1.0)`)
* **Dropdown:** Dropdown list for selecting from predefined options (e.g., `Dropdown(options=['a', 'b', 'c'])`)
* **Text:** Text input widget for entering strings (e.g., `Text()`)
* **Button:** Button widget for triggering actions (e.g., `Button(description='Click Me')`)

**Example:**

```python
from ipywidgets import IntSlider, VBox

# Create an integer slider widget
slider = IntSlider(min=0, max=100, value=50)slider = IntSlider(min=0, max=100, value=50)

# Create a vertical box layout to hold the widget
layout = VBox([slider])

# Display the layout in the notebook
display(layout)
```

**Updating Widget Values Dynamically**

* **Observables:** Use `observe` method to trigger callbacks when widget values change.
* **Linked Widgets:** Link widgets together to have their values automatically updated when one changes.

**Example:**

```python
# Create linked sliders
slider1 = IntSlider(min=0, max=100, value=25)
slider2 = IntSlider(min=0, max=100, value=75)

# Link the sliders
link = jupyter_core.link((slider1, 'value'), (slider2, 'value'))

# Display the sliders
display(slider1, slider2)
```

**Using Widgets to Control Data**

* **Data Interaction:** Widgets can be connected to dataframes and arrays to control data input and display.
* **Dataset Exploration:** Use interactive plots and data tables to visualize and explore data.

**Example:**

```python
# Import data into a dataframe
import pandas as pd```python
# Import data into a dataframe
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'radius': [2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0]})

# Create a slider widget for setting the maximum radius value
radius_slider = IntSlider(min=0, max=df['radius'].max(), value=3.0)

# Update the plot when the slider value changes
def update_plot(e):
    max_radius = e.new
    df['radius_filtered'] = df['radius'] <= max_radius
    plot = df.plot.scatter(x='radius', y='radius_filtered')
    display(plot)

# Connect the slider to the callback
radius_slider.observe(update_plot, 'value')

# Display the slider and plot
display(radius_slider)
```## Markdown Notes on Data Type Conversion: Float vs Integer

### Core Concept: Data Type Conversion

- In programming, data types define the format and range of values that a variable can hold.
- Data type conversion allows us to change the data type of a variable to suit specific operations or requirements.

### Float vs Integer### Float vs Integer

- **Float (floating-point number)**: Represents real numbers with decimal values, offering a wider range of precision.
- **Integer**: Represents whole numbers (without decimal part), suitable for counting or discrete values.

### Conversion Syntax in Python

```python
float(variable_name) # Converts an integer to a float
int(variable_name) # Converts a float to an integer
```

### Conversion Example

Consider the following code:

```python
radius = 10 # Radius as an integer

area = 3.14 * radius**2 # Calculating area using float value
maximum = 2500 # Maximum area as integer
minimum = 0.16 # Minimum area as float
```

### Problem: Type Inconsistency

- The `radius` variable is an integer, which leads to a type error when calculating the area.
- The `maximum` value is an integer, while the `minimum` value is a float, causing inconsistent data types.

### Solution: Convert Data Types

To fix the issue:

- Convert `radius` to a float using `float(radius)` before calculating the area.- Convert `maximum` to a float using `float(maximum)` to match the data type of `minimum`.

```python
radius = float(10) # Convert radius to float

area = 3.14 * radius**2 # Calculate area with float radius

maximum = float(2500) # Convert maximum to float
minimum = 0.16 # Minimum area remains as float
```

### Advantages of Data Type Conversion

- Ensures compatibility between different data types in operations.
- Improves accuracy and precision when dealing with real-world scenarios.
- Provides flexibility in data manipulation and calculations.**Markdown Notes on Using Sliders and Input Widgets**

**Introduction**

* Sliders and input widgets are interactive HTML elements that allow users to provide input to web applications.
* They are commonly used for adjusting values, entering text, or selecting options.

**Setting Default Values**

* You can set a default value for a slider or input widget using the `value` attribute.

```
<input type="range" value="50" />
```

**Retrieving Values from Sliders**```

**Retrieving Values from Sliders**

* The `value` of a slider can be retrieved using the `slider` function.

```
const sliderValue = document.getElementById("slider").value;
```

**Using Sliders to Build Charts and Predictions**

* The value of a slider can be used as input for building charts and making predictions.
* For example, you could use a slider to adjust the parameters of a machine learning model.

**Other Input Widgets**

* In addition to sliders, you can use other HTML input elements as widgets:
    * Text inputs: `<input type="text" />`
    * Checkboxes: `<input type="checkbox" />`
    * Radio buttons: `<input type="radio" />`
    * Dropdown lists: `<select>...</select>`

**Tips for Using Input Widgets**

* Choose the appropriate input widget for the type of input you need.
* Set meaningful default values.
* Use clear and concise labels to describe the purpose of each widget.
* Validate user input to ensure that it is valid.* Validate user input to ensure that it is valid.
* Handle user input events to respond to changes in the widget's value.**Title: Using Dictionaries to Collect Input**

**Introduction**
Dictionaries in programming languages are powerful data structures that allow us to store and access data using keys. In this lesson, we'll explore how to use dictionaries to collect input from users and prepare it for further processing.

**Step 1: Create a Dictionary**
To start, we create an empty dictionary using the curly braces notation:

```python
input_dict = {}
```

**Step 2: Add Key-Value Pairs**
For each input element, we add a key-value pair to the dictionary. The key is the name of the input element, and the value is the user's input.

```python
input_dict["radius_mean"] = 1413
```

**Example**
Let's say we have a form with three input fields: radius_mean, texture_mean, and perimeter_mean. We can collect the user's input into a dictionary as follows:

```python
input_dict = {
    "radius_mean": 1413,```python
input_dict = {
    "radius_mean": 1413,
    "texture_mean": 1038,
    "perimeter_mean": 1020
}
```

**Benefits of Using Dictionaries**
* **Organized Data:** Dictionaries keep input data organized and easily accessible by keys.
* **Dynamic Data:** Dictionaries allow us to add or remove key-value pairs dynamically as needed.
* **Efficient Access:** We can efficiently retrieve data from dictionaries using the keys, making it easy to work with large amounts of input.

**Conclusion**
Using dictionaries to collect input provides a flexible and efficient way to manage and prepare user data for further processing in your applications.**Creating a UI Input Dictionary with Streamlit**

**Background:**
Streamlit is a Python library designed to build custom interactive web apps. One common task in web apps is to collect user input. Streamlit provides a convenient way to create forms and sliders that capture user-provided values.

**Creating an Input Dictionary:****Creating an Input Dictionary:**
To create a dictionary that stores user-entered values from multiple inputs, follow these steps:

1. Import Streamlit:
```
import streamlit as st
```

2. Define a function to handle input collection:
```
def get_input_dictionary():
    input_dict = {}

    # Add each input to the dictionary
    # Key: Column Name, Value: User Input

    return input_dict
```

3. Create the UI in the main app:
```
# Get user input from the sidebar
input_data = get_input_dictionary()

# Display the input data
st.write(input_data)
```

**Example:**
Let's create a simple web app that collects user input for a column name and its corresponding value:

```
import streamlit as st

def get_input_dictionary():
    input_dict = {}
    column_name = st.text_input("Column Name")
    value = st.number_input("Value")
    input_dict[column_name] = value
    return input_dict

def main():
    input_data = get_input_dictionary()
    st.write(input_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code imports Streamlit, defines the `get_input_dictionary()` function to create the input dictionary, and uses Streamlit's `text_input` and `number_input` to collect user input. The collected data is then displayed on the web page.**Understanding Radar Charts**

**Core Concept:**

* A radar chart, also known as a spider chart or web diagram, visually represents multivariate data by using multiple axes radiating from a common center.

**Structure:**

**1. Components:**

* **Axes:** Radiating lines originating from the center, each representing a different variable.
* **Values:** Data points plotted on each axis.
* **Area:** The shape formed by connecting the data points, providing a visual representation of the distribution of values.

**2. Interpretation:**

* **Absolute Values:** The distance from the center to a data point indicates the value for that variable.* **Comparisons:** The relative positions of the data points on different axes allow for comparisons between variables.
* **Shape:** The shape of the area enclosed by the connected data points provides insights into the overall distribution of values.

**Building a Radar Chart:**

**1. Data Preparation:**

* Collect data for multiple variables.
* Ensure data is numeric and has a known center value (e.g., mean).

**2. Code Implementation:**

**Syntax:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6), subplot_kw=dict(polar=True))

# Set axes labels
ax.set_thetagrids(angles=[0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360], labels=['Var1', 'Var2', 'Var3', 'Var4', 'Var5', 'Var6', 'Var7'])

# Plot data
ax.plot([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70], label='Series 1')

# Add legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

**Example:**

This code generates a radar chart with 7 variables:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data for variables```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data for variables
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

# Create a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6), subplot_kw=dict(polar=True))

# Set axes labels
ax.set_thetagrids(angles=[0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360], labels=['Var1', 'Var2', 'Var3', 'Var4', 'Var5', 'Var6', 'Var7'])

# Plot data
ax.plot([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], data, label='Series 1')

# Add legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```**Data Column Structure**

**Concept:** Data columns are used to organize and represent data in a spreadsheet or database. They are arranged in a tabular format, with each column containing values for a specific variable or attribute.

**Key Details:**

* In the provided text, the data is not arranged in a single column for each variable (mean radius, standard error, and worst radius). Instead, these variables have separate columns.
* This structure is important to understand to avoid confusion when accessing or working with the data.

**Example:****Example:**

Imagine a spreadsheet with the following columns:

| Name | Age | Salary |
|---|---|---|
| John | 25 | $100,000 |
| Mary | 30 | $120,000 |

In this example, the "Age" and "Salary" columns are separate entities, even though they relate to the same person.

**Mapping Data Values**

**Concept:** Mapping is the process of assigning values from one source to another. In data processing, mapping is used to create relationships between different data sets or columns within a single data set.

**Key Details:**

* In the text, the process of mapping will involve assigning values from the mean radius, standard error, and worst radius columns into the respective traces of a chart.
* This mapping ensures that each trace contains the appropriate data for visualization.

**Example:**

Consider a chart with three traces (lines or bars):

1. **Trace 1:** Mean radius values
2. **Trace 2:** Standard error values
3. **Trace 3:** Worst radius values3. **Trace 3:** Worst radius values

The mapping process would involve assigning the mean radius values from the data column to Trace 1, the standard error values to Trace 2, and the worst radius values to Trace 3.**Interactive Data Visualization with Plotly**

# Create data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]

# Create Scatter plot
trace = go.Scatter(
    x=x,
    y=y
)

# Create layout
layout = go.Layout(
    title="Interactive Scatter Plot",
    hovermode='closest'
)

# Create figure
fig = go.Figure(data=[trace], layout=layout)

# Show chart
fig.show()
```

**Advantages of Plotly:**
* **User-friendly:** Easy to learn and use for beginners.
* **Powerful:** Capable of creating complex and interactive visualizations.
* **Versatile:** Works well with various data formats and supports a wide range of chart types.**Intro to Python Charting with Plotly**

**Overview:**
- Create interactive charts and visualizations in Python using the Plotly library.**Creating a Creator Chart:**

- Define a function, `get_creator_chart`, that takes a dictionary of values as an argument.
- Within the function, import the Plotly library if not already installed (pip install plotly).

**Code:**

```python
def get_creator_chart(my_input_data):
    import plotly.express as px
    return px.scatter(my_input_data,  x="value", y="key")
```

**Explanation:**
- Plotly uses `px.scatter` for scatter plots.
- The function takes a dictionary as input and plots the values ("value") against the keys ("key").
- The chart will be accessible within the function variable.## Plotly: Graph Objects vs. Express

### Understanding the Difference

Plotly is a powerful Python library for creating interactive visualizations. It offers two primary modules for creating charts:

**1. Graph Objects (go)**:

- Provides a high level of customization through individual graph objects.
- Allows precise control over every aspect of the chart's appearance and behavior.- Requires more code and understanding of the Plotly API.

**2. Express (express)**:

- Offers predefined chart templates with common configurations.
- Simplifies chart creation with less code.
- Limits customization options compared to Graph Objects.

### Choosing the Right Module

The choice between Graph Objects and Express depends on your specific needs:

- **Graph Objects:** Ideal for complex charts that require fine-tuning.
- **Express:** Suitable for quick and simple visualizations with predefined styles.

### Displaying Charts in Streamlit

**With Graph Objects:**

- Copy the chart code from Plotly's documentation.
- Change `fig.show` to `return fig`.

**With Express:**

- Create a Plotly Express chart using predefined functions (e.g., `px.bar`).
- Assign the chart to a variable (e.g., `chart`).
- Use Streamlit's `st.plotly_chart` function to display the chart in your app.

```python
# Using Graph Objects
fig = px.bar(df, x="category", y="value")
return fig

# Using Express
import streamlit as streturn fig

# Using Express
import streamlit as st
chart = px.bar(df, x="category", y="value")
st.plotly_chart(chart)
```**Topic: Understanding Streamlit's 'st.plotly_chart' Function**

**Core Concepts:**

* Streamlit: A Python library for creating interactive web applications
* 'st.plotly_chart': A Streamlit function used to display interactive charts

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

**1. Retrieve Chart Data**
   - Define a function to generate chart data
   - Assign the returned data to a variable

**2. Display Chart Using 'st.plotly_chart'**
   - Pass the data variable as an argument to 'st.plotly_chart()'
   - The function will display an interactive chart on the web page

**3. Customize Chart**
   - The chart can be customized by setting various options, such as:
     - Title, x/y axis labels, etc.
     - Legend, color scheme, etc.

**4. Update Chart with User Input**
   - To update the chart based on user input, use a Python callback function
   - The callback function should:
     - Process user input- The callback function should:
     - Process user input
     - Generate updated chart data
     - Update the chart data using 'st.plotly_chart()'

**Example:**

```python
import streamlit as st
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Define chart data function
def get_chart_data():
    return [
        go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6]),
        go.Scatter(x=[4, 5, 6], y=[7, 8, 9]),
    ]

# Display chart using 'st.plotly_chart'
data = get_chart_data()
st.plotly_chart(data)
```

**Additional Notes:**

* 'st.plotly_chart' requires the 'plotly' library to be installed
* The chart will be re-rendered whenever the web page is refreshed or updated
* By using callbacks, charts can be made interactive and responsive to user actions## Understanding Polar Coordinates

### Introduction
Polar coordinates are a system for representing points on a plane using their distance from a fixed point and the angle between a fixed line and the line connecting the point to the fixed point.

### Key Concepts### Key Concepts
- **Origin (O)**: The fixed point from which distances are measured.
- **Polar Axis (θ)**: The fixed line used to measure angles.
- **Radial Distance (r)**: The distance from the origin to the point.
- **Angular Value (θ)**: The angle between the polar axis and the line connecting the origin to the point.

### Representing Points in Polar Coordinates
A point in polar coordinates is represented as `(r, θ)`, where:
- `r` is the radial distance from the origin.
- `θ` is the angular value measured counterclockwise from the polar axis.

### Relationship to Cartesian Coordinates
Polar coordinates are related to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) as follows:
- `x = r cos(θ)`
- `y = r sin(θ)`

### Example
Let's represent the point `(1, √3)` in polar coordinates:
- `r` = distance from the origin = `√(1² + (√3)²) = 2`
- `θ` = angle from the polar axis = `arctan(√3/1) = 60°`
Therefore, the polar coordinate representation is `(2, 60°)`

### Applications of Polar Coordinates### Applications of Polar Coordinates
Polar coordinates are useful in various fields, including:
- Physics: Describing motion in circular paths
- Navigation: Determining the location of a ship or aircraft
- Calculus: Evaluating integrals and derivatives involving circular or spherical functions## Data Visualization using Perimeter Values

### Step 1: Replacing Perimeter Values

- Begin by replacing the values on the perimeter with the actual data points from the sidebar.
- For instance, "Processing Cost" on the perimeter corresponds to a list of values: "Radius," "Texture," "Area," etc.

### Step 2: Value Assignment

- Take the list of values (e.g., "Radius to Fractal Dimension") and assign them to each trace on the perimeter.
- Each trace represents a different data category (e.g., one to ten).
- Assign the values in order, starting from the first value ("Radius") for the first trace, and so on.

### Example

Consider the example provided:### Example

Consider the example provided:

- "Processing Cost" perimeter value corresponds to the following data categories:
    - Category 1: Radius
    - Category 2: Texture
    - Category 3: Area
    - Category 4: Concavity
    - Category 5: Fractal Dimension

- These data categories would be assigned to the first five traces, in that order.

### Tips

- If you encounter difficulties, replay the video or ask questions in the comments.
- Feel free to modify the values and observe how the visualization changes to understand the relationship between data and perimeter values.**Markdown Notes on plotly's Trace Object**

**Understanding the Trace Object**

The trace object in plotly is responsible for defining the data and appearance of a specific set of points on a graph.

**Properties of the Trace Object**

1. **name:** Specifies the name of the trace, which is displayed as a legend label.
   ```javascript
   trace['name'] = 'Product A'
   ``````javascript
   trace['name'] = 'Product A'
   ```

2. **type:** Indicates the type of trace, such as 'scatter' for line charts or 'bar' for bar charts.
   ```javascript
   trace['type'] = 'scatter'
   ```

3. **line:** Customizes the appearance of lines in line charts.
   - **color:** Sets the color of the lines.
   ```javascript
   trace['line']['color'] = 'red'
   ```

4. **fill:** Defines whether to fill the area between the line and the x-axis.
   - **toself:** Fill the area between the line and the starting point.
   - **none:** Do not fill the area.
   ```javascript
   trace['fill'] = 'tonexty'
   ```

5. **categories:** Specifies the categories or labels for the x-axis.
   ```javascript
   trace['categories'] = ['Product A', 'Product B']
   ```

6. **values:** Contains the numerical data points for the trace.
   ```javascript
   trace['values'] = [10, 20]
   ```

**Example**

To create a scatter plot with two traces, use the following code:

```python
fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2)```python
fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2)

# Define the first trace
trace1 = {
    'name': 'Product A',
    'type': 'scatter',
    'line': {'color': 'red'},
    'categories': ['Category A', 'Category B'],
    'values': [10, 20]
}

# Define the second trace
trace2 = {
    'name': 'Product B',
    'type': 'scatter',
    'line': {'color': 'blue'},
    'categories': ['Category A', 'Category B'],
    'values': [5, 15]
}

# Add traces to the subplot
fig.add_trace(trace1, row=1, col=1)
fig.add_trace(trace2, row=1, col=2)

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```**Markdown Notes for Data Manipulation in Python**

**Core Concepts:**

* **Input data:** Values passed into a function.
* **Dictionary:** A data structure that stores key-value pairs.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

**1. Accessing Input Data from a Dictionary**

* The **input data** for a function comes from a dictionary returned by a **sidebar**.
* The dictionary contains **key-value pairs**:
    * **Keys:** Names of columns in a dataset.* **Keys:** Names of columns in a dataset.
    * **Values:** Actual values associated with the columns.

**2. Identifying the Key for a Specific Value**

* To obtain a specific value from the dictionary, we need to identify the **key** associated with it.
* In this case, we want the key for the **mean value of the radius**.

**3. Mapping the Key to a Variable**

* Once we have the key, we can map it to a variable using the `=` assignment operator.
* For example: `radius_mean_key = "radius mean"`

**Syntax:**

```python
# Get the input data dictionary from the sidebar
input_data = get_sidebar_data()

# Identify the key for the mean radius value
radius_mean_key = "radius mean"

# Access the mean radius value using the key
radius_mean_value = input_data[radius_mean_key]
```

**Example:**

Let's say we have a scatter plot with a radius slider. The following code would retrieve the **mean radius** value from a sidebar:

```python
import plotly.graph_objs as go

# Create a scatter plot with a radius slider# Create a scatter plot with a radius slider
scatter = go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6], mode="markers", marker=dict(size=10))

# Add a radius slider to the sidebar
radius_slider = go.layout.Slider(currentvalue=10, min=1, max=20, step=1, name="Radius")

# Retrieve the mean radius value from the sidebar
radius_mean_key = "radius mean"
input_data = get_sidebar_data()
radius_mean_value = input_data[radius_mean_key]

# Update the radius of the scatter plot
scatter.marker.size = radius_mean_value
```**Notes on Feature Definition**

**Essential Concepts:**

- **Feature:** A measurable characteristic or property of an object or dataset that is used to describe or classify it.
- **Feature Extraction:** The process of identifying and extracting relevant features from raw data for analysis or modeling.

**Steps in Feature Definition:**

1. **Identify the relevant data source:** Determine the dataset or measurement device that will provide the raw data for feature extraction.2. **Extract raw data:** Access and gather the raw data from the specified source.

3. **Preprocess data:** Clean and transform the raw data to remove noise, outliers, and other issues.

4. **Identify potential features:** Examine the data to determine which characteristics or properties would be most informative for analysis.

5. **Calculate feature values:** Calculate the numerical values or categorical labels that represent each feature.

6. **Name and label features:** Assign descriptive names and labels to the features to facilitate identification and understanding.

**Example:**

**Input data:** Medical patient records

**Potential feature:** Age

**Feature calculation:** Extract the patient's age from the record and convert it to a numerical value (e.g., 55 years).

**Feature name:** Age**Markdown Notes on Understanding Formula**

**Understanding the Formula**

The formula is structured as follows:

```
mean_value <- mean(data[start:end])

standard_error <- radius * sd(data[start:end])
```standard_error <- radius * sd(data[start:end])
```

**Components of the Formula:**

* **mean_value:** The mean value of the data within the specified range.
* **mean:** The mean function calculates the average of a set of numbers.
* **data:** The input data from which the mean value is calculated.
* **start:** The starting index of the range.
* **end:** The ending index of the range.
* **standard_error:** The standard error of the mean value.
* **radius:** A constant used to calculate the standard error.
* **sd:** The standard deviation function calculates the standard deviation of a set of numbers.

**How the Formula Works:**

1. **Mean Value:** The mean function calculates the average of the data within the specified range.
2. **Standard Error:** The standard error is calculated by multiplying the radius by the standard deviation of the data within the specified range.

**Example:**

Let's calculate the mean value and standard error for the following data set:

```
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
``````
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

**Mean Value:**

```
mean_value <- mean(data[1:5])
mean_value
[1] 3
```

**Standard Error:**

```
radius <- 2
standard_error <- radius * sd(data[1:5])
standard_error
[1] 1.414214
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The range specified in `data[start:end]` should include all the relevant data points.
* The radius constant can be adjusted based on the desired level of confidence.
* Understanding the concepts of mean and standard deviation is essential for comprehending this formula.**Expert Notes on Radar Chart Creation**

**Creating a Radar Chart with Python**

**1. Basics of a Radar Chart:**
   - Represents multivariate data as a 2D polygon centered around a point.
   - Shows multiple variables and their values on a circular axis.
   - Useful for comparing different categories based on multiple metrics.

**2. Using Seaborn for Radar Chart Creation:**

   **Syntax:**
   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   sns.radar_plot(data=df, variables=variables_list, values=values_list)```

**3. Mapping Variables to Categories:**

   - **variables_list:** List of variables to be plotted on the circular axis.
   - **values_list:** Corresponding list of values for each variable.

**4. Customizing the Radar Chart:**

   **Example:**
   ```python
   sns.radar_plot(data=df, variables=['a', 'b', 'c'], values=['a_values', 'b_values', 'c_values'])
   ```

   - `radius_SE`: Radius for the standard error trace.
   - `radius_worst`: Radius for the worst value trace.
   - `name`: Name of the trace (e.g., "worst value").

**5. Troubleshooting Errors:**

   - Make sure the `variables_list` and `values_list` have the same length.
   - Check for any typographical errors in variable or value names.
**Markdown Notes: Debugging a Radar Chart in R**

**Introduction:**
- A radar chart is a graphical representation of multiple variables originating from a single point.
- It can help visualize complex multivariate data and identify relationships between categories.

**Error Identification:****Error Identification:**
- The text suggests an error in the code, causing the plot to show all values at 0.4.
- It mentions incorrect syntax with a comma and an extra space in the code.

**Steps to Debug:**
1. **Check Variable Definition**: Ensure that each category is defined as a unique element using correct syntax.
2. **Remove Commas and Spaces**: Check for accidental commas or spaces within the variable definitions.
3. **Replot the Chart**: Run the code again to see if the error has been resolved.

**Code Example:**

```r
# Create a radar chart

# Define categories - remove comma and space from "categories to self"
categories <- c("Worst Value", "Range", "Return Figure")

# Generate random data
data <- data.frame(
  Worst_Value = runif(10, min = 0, max = 1),
  Range = runif(10, min = 0, max = 1),
  Return_Figure = runif(10, min = 0, max = 1)
)

# Create the radar chart
radar_chart <- ggplot(data, aes(x = categories, y = value)) +
  geom_radar()

# Show the legend
radar_chart + geom_legend()
```# Show the legend
radar_chart + geom_legend()
```

**Conclusion:**
- Debugging errors in R code requires careful examination of the code, especially variable definitions.
- Proper use of syntax and removal of unnecessary characters can often resolve plot errors.
- By following these steps, you can ensure that your radar chart accurately represents your data.**Markdown Notes on Data Scaling for Radar Charts**

**Introduction**
- Radar charts are used to visualize multiple data values on a single graph.
- For clear and accurate visualization, it's essential to scale the data values to a common range.

**Step 1: Determine Value Ranges**
- Identify the minimum and maximum values for each data point.
- Example: Perimeter (0 to 188), Smoothness (0 to 0.16)

**Step 2: Scale Values to [0, 1] Range**
- Divide each value by the maximum value for its feature.
- Formula: Scaled Value = Original Value / Maximum Value

**Example:**
- Scaled Perimeter = 188 / 188 = 1
- Scaled Smoothness = 0.16 / 0.16 = 1- Scaled Smoothness = 0.16 / 0.16 = 1

**Step 3: Create Radar Chart Range**
- The radar chart is typically a circle divided into quadrants.
- The range of values (0 to 1) corresponds to the distance from the center to the edge of each quadrant.

**Benefits of Scaling**
- Ensures that all data points are represented fairly on the radar chart.
- Facilitates comparison between different features, regardless of their units of measurement.
- Improves the visual clarity and interpretability of the radar chart.

**Note:**
The scaling process should be applied consistently to all data values for accurate and meaningful visualization.**Unit Scaling**

**Concept:**
Unit scaling, also known as min-max scaling, transforms data by scaling it to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This process helps standardize data and improve algorithm performance.

**Steps:**

1. **Get Data:** Retrieve the data to be scaled.

2. **Compute Scaling Parameters:**
   a. Find the minimum and maximum values in the data.a. Find the minimum and maximum values in the data.
   b. Calculate the scaling range: range = max - min.

3. **Scale Values:** For each data point x in the dataset:
   a. Calculate the scaled value: x_scaled = (x - min) / range

4. **Output:** Return the scaled dictionary.

**Coding Example:**

```python
import numpy as np

def get_scaled_values(data):
  """Scales data to range [0, 1].

  Args:
    data: Dictionary containing data values.

  Returns:
    Dictionary with scaled values.
  """
  # Get predictors (features) and compute scaling range
  predictors = data.drop('target', axis=1)
  max_values = np.max(predictors, axis=0)
  min_values = np.min(predictors, axis=0)
  range_values = max_values - min_values

  # Scale values
  for col in predictors.columns:
    predictors[col] = (predictors[col] - min_values[col]) / range_values[col]

  # Return scaled data
  return predictors
```**Markdown Notes on Data Preprocessing: Dropping Columns and Creating a Scale Dictionary**

**Dropping Columns****Dropping Columns**

* **Purpose:** Remove unnecessary or redundant columns from a DataFrame.
* **Syntax:**
```
DataFrame.drop(labels, axis=0/1)
```
* **Parameters:**
    * `labels`: Column names or indices to drop.
    * `axis`: 0 for rows, 1 for columns (default).
* **Example:**
```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Bob'],
    'Age': [25, 22, 30],
    'Diagnosis': ['Healthy', 'Healthy', 'Diabetes']
})

df.drop('Diagnosis', axis=1)
```

**Creating a Scale Dictionary**

* **Purpose:** Create a dictionary that scales DataFrame values to a specified range.
* **Steps:**
    1. Initialize an empty dictionary `scale_dict`.
    2. Iterate over key-value pairs in the input dictionary `input_dict`.
    3. For each pair, calculate the maximum value as `max_value = max(value)` and minimum value as `min_value = min(value)`.
    4. Add the following key-value pairs to `scale_dict`:
        * `max`: `max_value`
        * `min`: `min_value`* `max`: `max_value`
        * `min`: `min_value`
        * `scaled`: (value - `min_value`) / (`max_value` - `min_value`)

* **Syntax for calculating the scaled value:**
```
(value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
```
* **Example:**
```
input_dict = {
    'Age': [25, 22, 30],
    'Height': [1.75, 1.65, 1.80]
}

scale_dict = {}
for key, value in input_dict.items():
    max_value = max(value)
    min_value = min(value)
    scale_dict[key] = {
        'max': max_value,
        'min': min_value,
        'scaled': (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
    }

print(scale_dict)
```**Concept: Data Scaling and Min-Max Normalization**

**Key Points:**

- Data scaling involves transforming data values into a consistent range to facilitate comparisons and improve algorithm performance.
- Min-max normalization is a specific scaling method that maps values to the interval [0, 1] by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum.**Steps for Min-Max Normalization in Python:**

**1. Calculate Minimum and Maximum Values:**
- For each column in the dataset:
  - Find the minimum value (`min_value`) and maximum value (`max_value`)

**2. Compute Scaled Value:**
- For each value (`x`) in the column:
  - Calculate: `scaled_value = (x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)`

**3. Update Dictionary:**
- Replace the original value in the input dictionary with the scaled value.

**Code Syntax:**

```python
import numpy as np

def min_max_scale(input_dict):
    # Store the scaled values
    scale_dict = {}
    
    for column in input_dict.keys():
        # Calculate min and max values
        min_value = np.min(input_dict[column])
        max_value = np.max(input_dict[column])
        
        # Scale each value in the column
        values = input_dict[column]
        for i in range(len(values)):
            values[i] = (values[i] - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
        
        # Update the scaled dictionary# Update the scaled dictionary
        scale_dict[column] = values
    
    return scale_dict
```

**Example:**

- Input dictionary:

```
input_dict = {'Age': [18, 25, 32], 'Height': [5.0, 5.5, 6.0], 'Weight': [70, 85, 90]}
```

- Scaled dictionary (after min-max scaling):

```
scale_dict = {'Age': [0.0, 0.33, 1.0], 'Height': [0.0, 0.5, 1.0], 'Weight': [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]}
```## Data Scaling for Radar Charts

### Objective

To enhance the visual representation of data in a radar chart by scaling values to a range of 0 to 1.

### Why Scaling?

* Ensures consistent visual representation across different datasets, regardless of their scale.
* Makes it easier to compare data points and identify patterns.
* Facilitates the creation of more informative and visually appealing radar charts.

### Algorithm

`get_scaled_values()`:

1. **Inputs**: A dictionary containing the values to be scaled.
2. **Process**:
   a. Determine the minimum and maximum values of the input dictionary.b. For each value in the input dictionary, calculate a scaled value using the formula: 
   ```
   scaled_value = (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
   ```
3. **Output**: A new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with scaled values between 0 and 1.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np

# Input dictionary with unscaled values
input_dict = {
    'Category A': 10,
    'Category B': 20,
    'Category C': 30
}

# Calculate scaled values
min_value = np.min(list(input_dict.values()))
max_value = np.max(list(input_dict.values()))
scaled_dict = get_scaled_values(input_dict, min_value, max_value)

# Output scaled dictionary
print(scaled_dict)

# Expected output:
# {'Category A': 0.25,
#  'Category B': 0.5,
#  'Category C': 0.75}
```

### Benefits of Data Scaling

* **Improved Data Visualization**: Data points are more comparable and patterns are more easily identifiable.* **Enhanced Accuracy**: Scaled values eliminate the influence of outliers, providing a more accurate representation of data distribution.
* **Increased Visual Appeal**: Radar charts with scaled values are more aesthetically pleasing and easier to interpret.## Scaling Data for Visualization

### Importance of Data Scaling

* Scaling data transforms values to a specific range, making data visualization more effective.
* This ensures that all values are visible and comparable on a graph.

### Scaling Data to [0, 1] Range

1. **Identify Min and Max Values:** Determine the minimum and maximum values of your data.

2. **Define New Range:** Specify the desired range of scaled values, typically [0, 1].

3. **Calculate Scaling Factor:** Divide the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the desired range (1 - 0 = 1).

4. **Apply Scaling:** Subtract the minimum value from each data point and then multiply by the scaling factor.

```python
# Example: Scale values between 0 and 2500 to [0, 1] range# Example: Scale values between 0 and 2500 to [0, 1] range

min_value = 0
max_value = 2500
scaling_factor = 1 / (max_value - min_value)  # (1 - 0 = 1)

scaled_value = (data_point - min_value) * scaling_factor
```

### Benefits of Scaling

* **Improved Visual Comparison:** All values are presented in a consistent range, allowing for easy comparison.
* **Reduced Clutter:** Extreme values no longer dominate the visualization, making trends and patterns more apparent.
* **Increased Accuracy:** Scales values within the visible range, preventing distortion caused by outliers.**Markdown Notes**

### Step 1: Loading the Model

* We use `pickle.load()` to load the saved model. This requires the model's location.
```python
with open('model/model.pickle', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
```

### Step 2: Loading Other Required Files (e.g., Scaler)

* In the same manner, we load any necessary additional files, such as a scaler.
```python
with open('model/scalar.pickle', 'rb') as file:
    scaler = pickle.load(file)
```

### Step 3: Converting Input Data```

### Step 3: Converting Input Data

* The input data is typically a dictionary of key-value pairs (parameter names and values).
* We need to convert this dictionary into a single array for prediction.

**Example:**

Consider a dictionary:
```
input_data = {
    'radius_mean': 1.5,
    'radius_se': 0.3,
    'texture_mean': 2.2,
    'texture_se': 0.6
}
```

* **Convert to an array:**
```python
# Convert the dictionary into a list of values
data_list = list(input_data.values())

# Convert the list into a NumPy array
data_array = np.array(data_list)
```

**Note:** The specific conversion method depends on your input data format and the requirements of your model.**Markdown Notes on Using NumPy Arrays**

**Introduction**

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library for working with arrays and matrices. In this guide, we'll explore how to convert a Python dictionary containing values into a single NumPy array.

**Step 1: Import NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np
```**Step 1: Import NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np
```

**Step 2: Create a NumPy Array**

To create a NumPy array from a list of values, use the `np.array()` function.

```python
input_array = np.array(input_data.values)
```

**Explanation:**

* `input_data.values` is a list containing the values from the input dictionary.
* The `np.array()` function converts the list into a NumPy array.

**Example:**

```python
input_data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

input_array = np.array(input_data.values)
print(input_array)  # Output: [1 2 3]
```

**Accessing Array Values**

You can access individual array values using their index.

```python
print(input_array[0])  # Output: 1
```

**Working with Input Arrays (Example)**

In the context of machine learning, you may need to convert input data into a NumPy array for processing.

```python
import numpy as np

input_data = {'age': [20, 30, 40], 'salary': [50000, 60000, 70000]}

input_array = np.array(input_data.values)input_array = np.array(input_data.values)

# Calculate the standard deviation of the input values
std_dev = np.std(input_array)

# Print the standard deviation
print(std_dev)  # Output: 11180.33988749895
```**Markdown Notes on Reshaping and Scaling Data for Machine Learning Models**

**Topics:**

1. **Reshaping Data**
2. **Scaling Data**

**1. Reshaping Data**

**Objective:** Convert a single-dimensional array into a two-dimensional array for compatibility with the model.

**Steps:**

1. The `reshape()` function resizes the array.
2. Provide the number of rows as the first argument (`1`).
3. Leave the second argument empty to calculate the number of columns automatically.
4. Example: `reshape(1, -1)`

**2. Scaling Data**

**Objective:** Adjust the values in the array to fit the model's expected range.

**Purpose:**

* Ensures that different features have similar magnitudes.
* Improves model performance and prevents overfitting.

**Steps:****Steps:**

1. Use a scaling technique, such as Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling.
2. Apply the scaler to the entire array, not just individual columns.
3. Ensure that the scaler used for training is also used for future predictions.
4. Example: If the original values were [1413, 14, 20, 12, 7], scaled values could be [-1, -0.99, -0.98, -0.97, -0.96].

**Code Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
import sklearn.preprocessing as sk

# Original array
X = np.array([[1413, 14, 20, 12, 7]])

# Reshape to 2D array
X = X.reshape(1, -1)

# Scale using Min-Max Scaling
scaler = sk.MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

**Important Notes:**

* Reshaping the data does not alter the values within the array.
* Data scaling can significantly impact the model's predictions, so it's crucial to choose the appropriate scaling method.**Understand Tensorflow Scalars**

**What is a Tensorflow Scalar?**

* A scalar is a basic data type in TensorFlow that represents a single numerical value.* It is the smallest unit of data in TensorFlow.

**Importance of Scaling Scalars**

* Scalars need to be scaled properly before using them in a model.
* Scaling ensures that the values are within a suitable range for training and inference.

**How to Scale Scalars**

**Using a Pre-Trained Scalar**

1. Import the scalar using `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model()`.
2. Use the `transform()` method of the imported scalar to transform the input array.

**Example:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the pre-trained scalar
scalar = tf.keras.experimental.load_saved_model("path/to/scalar")

# Scale the input array
scaled_array = scalar.transform(input_array)
```

**Understanding Default Scalar Values**

* By default, scalars set the values of sliders to the mean value of the corresponding column.
* This ensures that the scalars represent the central tendency of the data.
* The mean value is used because it is a common measure of central tendency.### Mean Normalization: A Comprehensive Guide#### Introduction
Mean normalization is a data preprocessing technique that transforms data values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This process helps to improve the performance of machine learning models by reducing the effect of outliers and making the data more manageable.

#### Steps of Mean Normalization
The steps involved in mean normalization are as follows:

1. **Calculate the mean of the data:** This is the average value of all the data points in the column.
2. **Subtract the mean from each data point:** This removes the mean from the data and centers it around zero.
3. **Divide each data point by its standard deviation:** This scales the data to have a standard deviation of 1 and brings extreme values closer to the mean.

#### Understanding the Transformation
Mean normalization transforms data values as follows:

- If a value is below the mean, it becomes negative after mean normalization.
- If a value is above the mean, it becomes positive after mean normalization.- All values that were initially equal to the mean will become zero after mean normalization.

#### Benefits of Mean Normalization
Mean normalization offers several benefits for machine learning models:

- It reduces the effect of outliers by bringing extreme values closer to the mean.
- It makes the data values more manageable and comparable.
- It improves the convergence and accuracy of gradient-based optimization algorithms.

#### Syntax
```
normalized_data = (data - mean) / standard_deviation
```

#### Example
Consider the following data column:

```
[100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
```

- **Mean:** 300
- **Standard deviation:** 100

After mean normalization, the values become:

```
[(100 - 300) / 100, (200 - 300) / 100, (300 - 300) / 100, (400 - 300) / 100, (500 - 300) / 100]
```

```
[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

#### Conclusion```

```
[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
```

#### Conclusion
Mean normalization is a valuable preprocessing technique that helps to improve the performance of machine learning models by reducing the effect of outliers and making the data more manageable. By understanding its steps, benefits, and implementation, you can effectively apply mean normalization to your data preprocessing tasks.**Concept:** Making Predictions Using Machine Learning Models

**High-Level Overview:**

- Machine learning models can be used to make predictions by analyzing data.
- Predictions can be used for a variety of applications, such as classifying objects, detecting anomalies, and forecasting future events.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Prepare the Input Data:** The input data should be formatted in a way that the model can understand. This may involve scaling the data to a specific range or converting it to a suitable representation (e.g., one-hot encoding).2. **Load and Execute the Model:** Load the trained machine learning model into the application and execute it on the input data.
3. **Obtain Predictions:** The model generates predictions based on the input data.
4. **Interpret Predictions:** The predictions may be raw values or probabilities. If necessary, convert the predictions to a human-readable format for presentation.

**Example:**

```
# Import the model
import my_model

# Create an input array scaled to the expected range
input_array_scaled = ...

# Predict using the model
prediction = my_model.predict(input_array_scaled)

# Interpret the prediction as a binary outcome (benign or malicious)
if prediction[0] == 0:
    print("Benign")
else:
    print("Malicious")
```

**Benefits of Using Predictions:**

- **Quick and efficient:** Predictions can be generated quickly, allowing for real-time decision-making.
- **Objective and unbiased:** Machine learning models are not influenced by human biases, providing more objective predictions.- **Extendable:** Predictions can be used as input to other models or systems, enabling more complex analysis and decision-making.

**Tips:**

- Use a model that is appropriate for the task and has been trained on relevant data.
- Consider the reliability and accuracy of the predictions, especially when making critical decisions.
- Regularly evaluate the performance of the model and retrain it as needed to maintain accuracy.**Machine Learning: Probability Prediction for Model Outputs**

**Concept:**
Machine learning models often classify input data and assign probabilities to different classifications. This helps determine the likelihood of a particular classification.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Model Prediction:**
   - `predict_probability` method returns an array with two elements.

2. **Probability Elements:**
   - First element: Probability of the input belonging to class 0
   - Second element: Probability of the input belonging to class 1

**Example:****Example:**

Say we have a binary classification model predicting whether an email is malicious (1) or benign (0).

```python
# Import the necessary library
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the data
X, y = load_dataset()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model
model = train_model(X_train, y_train)

# Get the probability for a test sample
input_data = X_test[0]
predicted_probability = model.predict_probability([input_data])[0]

# Interpret the probability
probability_benign = predicted_probability[0]
probability_malicious = predicted_probability[1]

print("Probability of benign:", probability_benign)
print("Probability of malicious:", probability_malicious)
```print("Probability of malicious:", probability_malicious)
```

**Note:** The interpretation of the probability values depends on the specific model and classification task. However, the basic principle remains the same: higher probability indicates a higher likelihood of a particular classification.**Understanding Machine Learning for Medical Diagnosis**

**Core Concepts:**

- **Machine Learning:** A field of computer science where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions.
- **Medical Diagnosis:** The process of diagnosing a medical condition based on symptoms and other information.
- **Classification:** A type of machine learning task where the model predicts the category or class that an input data point belongs to.

**Creating a Classifier for Benign vs. Malignant Cells:**

**Step 1: Data Collection**
- Gather a dataset of cell samples, labeled as benign or malignant.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing****Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
- Clean and prepare the data by removing irrelevant features and scaling numerical values.

**Step 3: Feature Selection**
- Identify the features in the data that are most relevant for distinguishing benign from malignant cells.

**Step 4: Model Training**
- Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine) and train it on the preprocessed data.

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('cell_samples.csv')

# Preprocess data
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('label', axis=1), data['label'], test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Step 5: Model Evaluation**model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Step 5: Model Evaluation**
- Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

**Step 6: Deployment**
- Save the trained model and use it to make predictions on new cell samples.

**Disclaimer:**
- Machine learning models should not be used as a sole basis for medical diagnosis. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for a diagnosis.**Markdown Notes on Building a Cell Cluster Prediction App**

    * Inspect the element you want to modify.
    * Copy the CSS class associated with the element.
* **Modifying Styles:**
    * In your "style.css" file, use the copied class to make modifications.
    * For example, let's add padding:
        ```css
        .my-custom-class {
          padding: 1rem;
        }
        ```

**4. Tips**

* Keep your modifications close to the default styles provided by Streamline.
* Use clear and concise language in your stylesheet.
### Understanding REM Units in CSS

**What is REM?**### Understanding REM Units in CSS

**What is REM?**

REM (Root EM) is a relative length unit in CSS that is based on the font size of the root element (usually the `<html>` element). It allows you to scale the size of elements relative to the font size.

**Benefits of using REM:**

- **Responsiveness:** REM units ensure that elements scale proportionally with the font size, making your design responsive to different screen sizes.
- **Consistency:** REM units help maintain consistency in the size of elements across different browsers and devices with different default font sizes.
- **Flexibility:** You can easily adjust the font size of the root element to change the overall size of all elements using REM units.

**Example:**

```css
html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.my-element {
  width: 2rem;
}
```

In this example, the `.my-element` will have a width of 32 pixels (2 * 16px). If you increase the font size of the root element to 20px, the width of `.my-element` will automatically adjust to 40px (2 * 20px).**Tips for using REM:**

- Avoid using REM units for elements that need absolute positioning.
- Use REM units sparingly for elements that need precise pixel values (e.g., borders).
- Consider using media queries to adjust the font size of the root element based on different screen sizes.**Markdown: A Styling Hack**

**Introduction**

Markdown is a simple markup language for creating structured text. It was initially designed for creating readable online documents and formatting emails. However, in this case, we're going to use Markdown as a styling mechanism for a web application.

**How it Works**

Markdown allows you to import CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) into a web application as a markdown file. This enables you to control the appearance of your application using stylesheets, but within the framework of Markdown.

**Implementation**

1. **Create a Markdown file:** Create a new file with a `.md` extension.

2. **Include CSS styles:** Within the Markdown file, add the following code:
   ``````
   <style type="text/css">
   /* Import your CSS file */
   @import url('path_to_your_stylesheet.css');
   </style>
   ```

3. **Allow unsafe HTML:** To allow the browser to parse the CSS as HTML, add the following attribute to the `style` tag:
   ```
   unsafe-allow-html
   ```

**Example**

Consider the following Markdown file called `styles.md`:
```
---
<style type="text/css" unsafe-allow-html>
@import url('format.css');
</style>
---
```
This file imports the CSS file `format.css` and applies its styles to the web application.

**Benefits of this Technique**

* **Simplicity:** Markdown is a simple and accessible language, making it easy to write and understand CSS styles.
* **Maintainability:** Storing styles in a separate markdown file promotes modularity and allows for easier updates.
* **Customization:** Markdown enables you to easily customize the appearance of your web application without modifying the application's codebase directly.

**Note:****Note:**

This technique is a workaround and may not be supported in all browsers. Always test your code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in all target environments.## Enhancing Prediction Display with CSS Styling

### Objective:
Incorporate CSS styling to enhance the visual representation of predicted labels (benign or malicious).

### Implementation Steps:

**1. Add a Span Element:**

* Within the prediction formatting code, wrap the prediction label (e.g., "benign" or "malicious") in a `<span>` element.
* Assign a class attribute to the span element, such as "diagnosis-benign".

**2. Custom CSS Styling:**

* In the CSS file, define a style rule for the "diagnosis-benign" class:
```css
.diagnosis-benign {
  color: green;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
* Repeat this process for the "diagnosis-malicious" class, using the appropriate color (e.g., red) and other desired styling.

### Example Code:

```html
// Prediction formatting code
const prediction = model.predict(data);const prediction = model.predict(data);
let outputString = `<span class="diagnosis-${prediction}">${prediction}</span>`;
```

```css
// CSS styling
.diagnosis-benign {
  color: green;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.diagnosis-malicious {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

### Results:

* The prediction labels will now be displayed with the applied CSS styling (e.g., green for benign, red for malicious).
* This improves the visual presentation and makes it easier to distinguish between the different labels.## Styling HTML Elements in CSS

**Concepts to Understand:**

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the appearance of HTML elements on a web page.
- HTML elements can be targeted and styled using classes and IDs.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Allow HTML Parsing:** To style HTML elements inside of a CSS file, you must set the CSS property `safe` to `true`. This allows CSS to interpret HTML tags within the content.

```css
html {
  safe: true;
}
``````css
html {
  safe: true;
}
```

2. **Target HTML Classes:** To style specific HTML elements based on their class, use the class selector in CSS. For example, to style all elements with the class `diagnosis`, use the following syntax:

```css
.diagnosis {
  ...styling properties...
}
```

3. **Example of Styling HTML Elements:** Let's say we have the following HTML structure:

```html
<span class="diagnosis benign">Benign</span>
<span class="diagnosis malicious">Malicious</span>
```

To style the "Benign" text differently from the "Malicious" text, we would add the following CSS rules:

```css
.diagnosis.benign {
  color: white;
  padding: 0.2rem 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

.diagnosis.malicious {
  color: red;
  padding: 0.2rem 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

This would change the appearance of the "Benign" text to white with rounded corners and padding, while the "Malicious" text would be red with the same styling.## Customizing Background Color Based on Element Class

### Overview### Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to dynamically change the background color of an HTML element based on its CSS class. This technique is commonly used to provide visual cues and enhance the user experience.

### HTML

```html
<p class="benign">This is benign text.</p>
<p class="malicious">This is malicious text.</p>
```

### CSS

```css
.benign {
  background-color: green;
}

.malicious {
  background-color: red;
}
```

### JavaScript

To change the background color based on element class, you can use the `classList` property to add and remove classes:

```javascript
const benignElement = document.querySelector('.benign');
const maliciousElement = document.querySelector('.malicious');

// Change benign element to green background
benignElement.classList.add('benign');

// Change malicious element to red background
maliciousElement.classList.add('malicious');
```

### ExamplemaliciousElement.classList.add('malicious');
```

### Example

When you run the code, the "benign" paragraph will have a green background, and the "malicious" paragraph will have a red background.

```
<p class="benign">This is benign text.</p>
<p class="malicious">This is malicious text.</p>

<style>
  .benign {
    background-color: green;
  }

  .malicious {
    background-color: red;
  }
</style>

<script>
  const benignElement = document.querySelector('.benign');
  const maliciousElement = document.querySelector('.malicious');

  benignElement.classList.add('benign');
  maliciousElement.classList.add('malicious');
</script>

**Core Concept**

Logistic regression is a statistical model used to predict the probability of an event occurring. It is commonly employed in binary classification tasks, where the outcome variable can take only two possible values (e.g., yes/no, true/false).

**Key Details**

* **Linear Model:** Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the log-odds of the event occurring.
* **Sigmoid Function:** The output of the logistic regression model is passed through a sigmoid function to convert it into a probability value between 0 and 1.
* **Cost Function:** The model is trained by minimizing a cost function (e.g., cross-entropy) that measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes.

**Example and Analogy****Example and Analogy**

Imagine you want to predict the probability of a customer making a purchase based on their demographics. A logistic regression model could be built to learn the relationship between the customer's age, income, and education level and the likelihood of a purchase.

**How Logistic Regression Works**

1. **Gather data:** Collect data on the independent variables and the outcome variable.
2. **Build the model:** Fit a linear regression model to the data, with the log-odds of the outcome as the dependent variable.
3. **Apply the sigmoid function:** Convert the linear predictions into probabilities using the sigmoid function.
4. **Evaluate the model:** Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's performance.

**Code Example**

```python
import sklearn.linear_model

# Create a logistic regression classifier
classifier = sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model to training data
classifier.fit(train_data, train_y)classifier.fit(train_data, train_y)

# Predict probabilities on new data
prediction_probs = classifier.predict_proba(new_data)

# Extract predicted classes
predictions = np.argmax(prediction_probs, axis=1)
```
